# React + TypeScript Project

This project was developed using **React** and **TypeScript**, focusing on best practices, modern styling, and automated testing on the frontend.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React** with **TypeScript**
- **Chakra UI** – for building accessible and styled components
- **Styled Components** – studied and applied for dynamic styling
- **Jest** + **React Testing Library** – implementing **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** in the frontend

## 📂 Project Structure

- `src/components` → Reusable components  
- `src/pages` → Application pages  
- `src/styles` → Global styles and theme configuration  
- `src/tests` → Unit and integration tests  
- `src/services` → External services and API integrations  

## 🧪 Tests

This project was built following the **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** methodology, ensuring higher quality and reliability in the codebase.  
You can run the tests with:

```bash
npm test
````

or

```bash
yarn test
```

## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd project-name
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or

   yarn install
   ```
4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

## 📖 Key Learnings

Throughout the development, I explored and applied:

* Static typing and interfaces with **TypeScript**
* Styling with **Styled Components** and **Chakra UI**
* Unit testing and TDD practices with **Jest** and **React Testing Library**
